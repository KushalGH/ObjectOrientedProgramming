# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Sometimes is tough to define even a simple definition. Starting with some of the very basic OOP definations.

* Encapsulation: A group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
* Inheritance: The ability to create new classes based on an existing class.
* Polymorphism: Means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
* Class and Object: Using the blueprint analogy, a class is a blueprint, and an object is a building made from that blueprint.
* Class Members: 
  * hh
  * jj
